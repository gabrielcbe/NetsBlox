    <h1>NetsBlox Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        Your privacy and safety online are very important to us. To protect your
        privacy, we limit what we collect and what we publish on the website.
        Although, as a nonprofit educational institution, we are technically
        exempt from the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
        (COPPA), we are voluntarily following its rules about data collection
        from children under 13.
    </p>

    <p>
        We follow industry standards to maintain the security of our web
        server.  However, we cannot absolutely guarantee that malicious third
        parties will be unable to break into our database.  This privacy policy
        explains how our authorized staff and contractors will use your information.

    </p>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>Using our software</h3>

    You can <a href="/">program in NetsBlox</a> without providing us with any
    personally identifiable information at all. Without creating an account, you can still save projects on your own computer and not on our cloud. However, some of the collaboration capabilities require account creation to be able to invite and share projects with other users. You can also, without
    providing any personally identifiable information, download our example projects, libraries,
    and other public media.

    <h3>Creating a NetsBlox account</h3>
    <p>
        If you wish to save the projects you create on our cloud
        server, then you must create an account on this site so that
        your storage is separate from other people's storage.  When
        you create an account, we collect your email address or, if you are
        under 13, your parent's or guardian's email address.  We use
        your address for three purposes:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>When you sign up for an account, we immediately send you a confirming email with your account's initial password.</li>
        <li>If you forget your password, we use your address to send you a password-reset email.</li>
        <li>If your account is suspended for violation of our <a href="/tos.html">Terms of Service</a>, we will notify you by email.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        We do not use your address for any other purpose.  You will
        never receive marketing emails of any kind through this site,
        neither from us nor from third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not share your address with anyone else, except for
        companies contracted with us to provide services to us (see
        below, "for further questions").  Any such companies agree to obey this
        privacy policy.  The only exception is that we might be
        compelled by legal subpoena to provide information to police
        agencies or courts.
    </p>
    <p>
        We ask for your month and year of birth when you sign up in order
        to decide whether to ask for your own email address or your parent's
        email address.  But this partial birthdate information is never sent
        to our server; it is used only on your computer during the signup dialog.
    </p>
    <h3>Information in your projects</h3>

    You can save projects on our server for your personal use,
    or you can explicitly choose to share a project with the other
    users of this site.

    <p>
        Projects that you choose to share are available for anyone
        to examine. We may examine shared projects for research purposes.
        <i>We urge you strongly not to include personally identifying
        information in your shared projects!</i>  For example, if you post a
        project that says "today is my birthday" you are telling the
        entire world your date of birth, which is a very important piece
        of personally identifying information.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we are notified by a third party that your shared project
        includes their copyrighted content (such as a musical performance),
        we are required by law to investigate, and may revoke the shared
        status of that project.
    </p>
    <h3>Communications that you initiate</h3>

    <p>
        If you contact us by email, we save
        your email address and whatever other information you include in
        your message long enough to respond to you, which might take some
        time if your message is a bug report.  We then delete your
        email.
    </p>
    <h3>Server logging</h3>

    <p>
        This site is hosted at the Vanderbilt University,
        Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department.
        This web server collects the following information: Internet Protocol (IP)
        address of computer being used; web pages requested; referring web page;
        browser used; date and time; and statistics identifying particular IP
        addresses from which our websites are accessed. We do not associate this data
        to individual user identities. The editor also reports some usage metrics.
    </p>

    <p>
        This information is used to improve the technical quality of the site,
        and may be used for investigation of deliberate attempts to deny the use
        of our site to others.  We do not log personally identifiable
        information, except that your IP address may indicate your
        Internet service provider and your general geographic area.
    </p>
    <h3>Google Analytics</h3>

    <p>
        Like many other web sites, we use Google Analytics to collect
        statistical information about how our site is used.  We get only
        general statistical information from Google Analytics, not
        personally identifiable information.  <i>However, if you have ever
        used other Google services, then Google knows who you are.</i>  We have
        no control over their use of information; see
        <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">Google's
        privacy policy</a> for more information.
    </p>
        <p>
            We recommend that you use
            <a href="http://adblockplus.org/">AdBlock Plus</a>,
            <a href="http://ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a>,
            <a href="http://noscript.org/">NoScript</a>, and/or
            <a href="http://privoxy.org/">Privoxy</a> to protect your browsing privacy.
            The first two are really easy to install and use; the last two take a bit
            more effort to whitelist sites you trust.
            (You might also consider the tracking-free
            <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> search engine.)
            We have no connection with any of those services.
        </p>

        <h2>How to remove your information</h2>

        <p>
            If you delete your account on our site, we will delete all the information associated with
            that account, including your email and your saved projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you are the parent of a child with an account on this site
            and would like us to remove the account, please
            contact us, and include in your
            message your child's account name, the email address associated
            with the account, and a way to contact you offline (to prevent
            forgeries).
        </p>
